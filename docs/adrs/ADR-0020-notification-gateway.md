# ADR-0020: Bidirectional Notification Gateway (superseded)

This ADR was revised before acceptance. The decision was updated to use an OpenAI-compatible
`/v1/chat/completions` endpoint instead of a custom notification gateway.

See [ADR-0020: OpenAI-Compatible Chat Endpoint for Mobile Access](./ADR-0020-openai-compatible-chat-endpoint.md)
for the accepted decision.
